SRAM Part A. 1K Bit SRAM Schematic Design
----
### 1 Briefly explanation
This is a 1024-bit SRAM with four 256-bit banks. <br />
1. Address bits are [A5:A0], I used the MSB four bits which are A5A4A3A2 for word line selecting, and LSB two bits which are A1A0 for bank selecting. <br />
2. To save area in layout design and to reduce the wire delay, I did not arrange the bit lines consecutively (i.e. BL0, BL1, BL2 â€¦ BL63). Instead, I put together BLs which are suppose to converge into the same column MUX (i.e. BL0, BL16, BL32, BL48, BL1, BL17,ect).<br />
3. I put sense amplifier after the MUX, so I need only 16 SAs instead of 64.<br />
4. To ensure fast charging and discharging of the long word lines, I add an dedicated 4x inverter before each bank. Hence the output of row decoder are ~WLs instead of WL.<br />
5. I used two level column MUX, which is 4-to-1, and I combined the read and write MUX together using all NMOSs and all PMOSs. Hence the column decoder can be saved. Since the MUXs are put before the sense amplifier, the read MUX is all PMOSs and carefully sized so that it can pass delta V as low as 200mv within a short time.<br />

Summary of key parameters
Area:253.3*98.5=24950.05um2

Minimal clock period:
To find the minimal clock period, I gradually reduced the tunit in the input vector file, until the result started to go wrong. The minimum clock period of this deign is 6.1ns.
